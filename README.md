# dotfiles

My start for getting some awesome dotfiles. My startingpoint is mostly a fork of [Mathias Bynens'](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) dotfiles. Go check them out they're awesome, also make sure you check his [.osx file](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.osx) it's ledgendary!

## Usage

Make symlinks so you can use them with bash

``` 
ln -s <filepath> <linkpath> 
```

### Example

```
ln -s ~/Projects/dotfiles/.bash_profile ~/.bash_profile
```

I'll hopefully find a better way to meke the symlinks in the future, but this will work until then.
