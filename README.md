# dotfiles

My start for getting some awesome dotfiles. My startingpoint ~~is~~ was mostly a fork of [Mathias Bynens'](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) bash files witch I've now stopped using since I've gone over to use Zsh. My Vim config ~~is~~ was a fork of [Harry Roberts'](https://github.com/csswizardry/dotfiles) vimrc for a startingpoint. Go check them out they're both awesome. My Sublime config have been evolving over the past few years and i tend to switch color scheme atleast once a month. Can't remember where I forked my tmux.conf, sorry.
