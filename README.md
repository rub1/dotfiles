# dotfiles

My start for getting some awesome dotfiles. My startingpoint ~~is~~ was mostly a fork of [Mathias Bynens'](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) bash files witch Ive now stopped using since Im now using Zsh. My Vim config is a fork of [Harry Roberts'](https://github.com/csswizardry/dotfiles) vimrc for a startingpoint. Go check them out they're awesome, also make sure you check Mathias' [.osx file](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.osx) it's ledgendary! My Sublime config have been evolving over the past few years and i tend tot switch color scheme atleast once a month.

## Usage

Make symlinks so you can use them with bash

``` 
ln -s <filepath> <linkpath> 
```

### Example

```
ln -s ~/Projects/dotfiles/.bash_profile ~/.bash_profile
```

I'll hopefully find a better way to make the symlinks in the future, but this will work until then.
